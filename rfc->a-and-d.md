# A&D: Improving Cache hit rate for Homepage Content Providers

Original RFC: Not available

# Description

Based on the RFC document provided, here is an analysis focused on listing the facts and symptoms as described while highlighting any associated weaknesses, biases, and suggesting improvements:

### Facts & Symptoms

1. **Etag cache hit rate is between 40% and 45%**: This is significantly lower than expected, indicating inefficiency in the design or implementation of the cache system.
   - **Weakness/Bias**: The document assumes a higher expected hit rate without explicitly stating the basis for this expectation, which could introduce bias about the perceived severity of the issue.
   - **Improvement**: Clarify the expected hit rate and the reasoning or data behind these expectations to better frame the problem and avoid assumptions.

2. **Goal to achieve a 100% hit rate for active customers**: Establishes a clear objective for the RFC.
   - **Weakness/Bias**: Setting a goal of 100% might not be realistic due to potential external factors and system limitations. This goal might introduce a bias towards over-engineering solutions.
   - **Improvement**: Set a more flexible target range for hit rates, allowing for a buffer that accounts for uncontrollable variables.

3. **Use of Elasticache/Redis in a non-clustered mode**: This contributes to the issue of memory use inefficiency and bottlenecking on a single node.
   - **Weakness/Bias**: The description suggests a technical constraint without exploring the initial decision for such a setup, potentially overlooking historical or contextual factors that led to this choice.
   - **Improvement**: Provide context on the decision to use non-clustered mode and evaluate if previous constraints still apply.

4. **Experiment with upgraded node size resulting in marginal improvements**: Shows that simply increasing infrastructure capacity doesn't linearly translate to performance gains.
   - **Weakness/Bias**: Assumes that the scale of hardware is a primary lever for performance improvement, potentially neglecting algorithmic or architecture optimizations.
   - **Improvement**: Alongside hardware scaling, consider evaluating and including algorithmic efficiencies and cache invalidation strategies.

5. **Cost implications of changes are significant**: The RFC provides a detailed breakdown of cost implications for proposed solutions.
   - **Weakness/Bias**: Focusing heavily on cost could bias the document towards cheaper, possibly sub-optimal solutions in terms of performance or scalability.
   - **Improvement**: Balance cost considerations with performance benefits, possibly including a cost-benefit analysis to support decision-making.

6. **Open questions about cache hit rate goals and cost priorities**: Indicates areas of strategic uncertainty.
   - **Weakness/Bias**: These open questions might delay decision-making or lead to solutions that are misaligned with unstated strategic priorities.
   - **Improvement**: Prior to proposing solutions, engage stakeholders to clarify strategic objectives and priorities regarding cost vs. performance trade-offs.

### Overall Recommendations

- **Explicate Assumptions and Basis of Expectations**: Clarifying why certain expectations or objectives are set the way they are helps minimize bias and allows for a more grounded discussion of the problem and potential solutions.
- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensuring that the proposed solutions or investigative directions align with the broader strategic goals of the organization can prevent effort misallocation.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Incorporate a more nuanced cost-benefit analysis that weighs not just the monetary cost but the potential long-term benefits of scalability, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
- **Comprehensive Solution Evaluation**: Assess proposed solutions not just in isolation but how they integrate into the existing ecosystem, potentially uncovering compound benefits or drawbacks not evident when viewed in isolation.

# Problem(s)

### Weak Aspects of the Original Problem Statement

The original problem statement is implicit within the symptoms and analysis discussed but lacks a direct, clear statement of the problem in itself. This means we have to infer it from the context provided, which can lead to misunderstandings or misalignments in attempting to solve it. Specifically:

1. **Lacks Precision and Clarity**: It does not succinctly state the problem, instead spreading it across multiple symptoms and analyses.
2. **Implicit Goal**: The goal of improving the Etag cache hit rate is buried within the symptoms rather than explicitly stated as the problem to solve.
3. **Solution Encoding**: It hints at solutions (e.g., not using Elasticache/Redis in a non-clustered mode) rather than strictly describing the problem.
4. **Lacks Objective / Obstacle Format**: It does not separate the desired state (objective) from the current challenges (obstacles) in a structured manner.

### Revised Problem Statement in Objective / Obstacle Format

**Objective**: Achieve an Etag cache hit rate of at least 80% for active customers to ensure efficient and rapid data retrieval, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.

**Obstacle**: Currently, the Etag cache hit rate is languishing between 40% and 45%, constrained by the utilization of Elasticache/Redis in a non-clustered mode leading to inefficiencies and bottlenecking on a single node. Experimentation with upgraded node sizes has only yielded marginal improvements, suggesting that the issue may not be resolved through hardware enhancements alone. Additionally, cost implications of potential changes are significant and need careful consideration.

### Suggestions for Further Thinking

1. **Clarify Expectations vs. Industry Standards**: Research and articulate what Etag cache hit rates are realistic and standard across similar industries or technologies. This may adjust the objective to be more attainable or reveal that the target hit rate is indeed feasible but requires specific strategies.
   
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Conduct a deeper root-cause analysis to understand why the hit rate is low. While hardware limitations and the Redis setup are identified obstacles, there may be underlying issues such as cache invalidation logic, data access patterns, or network latency affecting performance.
   
3. **Broaden the Solution Space**: By not presupposing that hardware upgrades or clustering are the only solutions, explore a wider array of potential improvements. This might include algorithmic optimizations, changes in cache eviction policies, or even architectural changes in how data is stored and retrieved.
   
4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Incorporate a detailed cost-benefit analysis for each proposed solution to understand its impact not just on performance, but also on operational and capital expenses. This analysis should include estimates of ROI based on expected improvements in efficiency, scalability, and customer satisfaction.
   
5. **Stakeholder Prioritization and Strategic Alignment**: Engage with stakeholders to prioritize the obstacles based on their impact on the business objectives. This may lead to a re-evaluation of the objective itself, or a phased approach to overcoming obstacles based on strategic priorities, such as focusing on quick wins that offer significant improvements before investing in more costly solutions.
   
6. **Experimental and Iterative Approach**: Consider adopting an experimental approach to solution implementation, where smaller changes are tested and measured for their impact on the cache hit rate. This approach allows for iterative improvements and avoids the risk of significant resource allocation to strategies that may not yield the desired improvement.

By applying these suggestions, the problem-solving process can become more structured, informed, and aligned with strategic objectives, thus increasing the likelihood of identifying and implementing effective solutions.

# Solution Space

## Criteria We Care About

Based on the provided RFC documentation and focusing on the "Decision Matrices" guidelines from the "Practical Analysis and Design" text, we can derive criteria for use in a Decision Matrix related to improving the hit rate of the etag cache used by Moon (Homepage) for calling content providers. 

### Extracted Criteria:

1. **Affordability**: Costs associated with implementing and maintaining the solution.
2. **Efficiency**: Improvement in cache hit rate and reduction in latency.
3. **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load without significant degradation in performance.
4. **Implementation Difficulty / Complexity**: Effort and technical challenge involved in implementing the proposed solution.
5. **Time to Market**: Speed at which the solution can be deployed and start delivering value.
6. **Operational Requirements (Burden)**: Additional operational overhead introduced by the solution (e.g., maintenance, monitoring).
7. **Alignment with Organizational Goals / Strategy**: How well the solution aligns with broader company objectives and strategies.
8. **User Experience**: Impact on the end-user experience, particularly in terms of latency and availability.
9. **Market & Competitive Conditions**: Considerations on how the solution positions the organization in the marketplace or against competitors.
10. **Entropy Added to Existing Systems**: How much complexity the solution adds to the current ecosystem.
11. **Problems Introduced by the Solution**: Potential new issues or complications the solution might introduce.

### Critique and Suggested Improvements:

1. **Affordability**:
   - **Weakness**: May be too narrowly focused on direct costs, omitting indirect costs such as opportunity costs or future scalability costs.
   - **Improvement**: Expand to include a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) evaluation.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - **Weakness**: Efficiency could be conflated with performance; specificity can improve clarity.
   - **Improvement**: Split into cache hit rate efficiency and system performance efficiency to remove ambiguity.

3. **Scalability**:
   - **Weakness**: Does not specify whether vertical or horizontal scalability is more desirable based on solution constraints.
   - **Improvement**: Define scalability criteria in terms of specific growth metrics (e.g., customer load, data volume).

4. **Implementation Difficulty / Complexity**:
   - **Weakness**: Subjective and could vary widely based on the team's skill set.
   - **Improvement**: Include criteria for available expertise and learning curve for new technologies involved.

5. **Time to Market**:
   - **Weakness**: Does not account for potential delays due to unforeseen challenges.
   - **Improvement**: Supplement with risk assessment criteria to gauge potential delays.

6. **Operational Requirements (Burden)**:
   - **Weakness**: "Burden" is subjective and may not capture all types of operational impact.
   - **Improvement**: Specify operational metrics such as hours of maintenance required per week.

7. **Alignment with Organizational Goals / Strategy**:
   - **Weakness**: May be difficult to quantify in comparison to other more tangible criteria.
   - **Improvement**: Use a scoring system based on strategic fit determined by stakeholders.

8. **User Experience**:
   - **Weakness**: Needs quantification to be effectively measured.
   - **Improvement**: Define UX metrics (e.g., load times, downtime frequency).

9. **Market & Competitive Conditions**:
   - **Weakness**: Can be too broad and not directly applicable to all solution considerations.
   - **Improvement**: Focus on specific competitive advantages or market needs addressed by the solution.

10. **Entropy Added to Existing Systems**:
    - **Weakness**: "Entropy" is metaphorical and might confuse rather than clarify.
    - **Improvement**: Reframe as "System Complexity Increase" with quantifiable metrics where possible.

11. **Problems Introduced by the Solution**:
    - **Weakness**: Negative framing could bias assessment against certain solutions.
    - **Improvement**: Reframe as "Risk Factors" with a focus on mitigation strategies.

These improvements aim to address weaknesses and biases in the criteria, enhancing clarity, objectivity, and the usefulness of the Decision Matrix in evaluating proposed solutions within the context provided by the RFC documentation.
